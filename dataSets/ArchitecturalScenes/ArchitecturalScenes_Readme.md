## Architectural Scenes data set

The Architectural Scenes image set was first used in:

Vartanian, O., Navarrete, G., Chatterjee, A., Fich, L.B., 
Leder, H., Modroño, C., Nadal, M., Rostrup, N., Skov, M., 2013. 
Impact of contour on aesthetic judgments and approach-avoidance 
decisions in architecture. Proceedings of the National Academie 
of Sciences 110, 10446–10453. (https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1301227110)

It has been used in several other publications since then.

The line drawings were generated by automatically detecting and 
tracing contours using the [MLV Toolbox](http://mlvtoolbox.org)
