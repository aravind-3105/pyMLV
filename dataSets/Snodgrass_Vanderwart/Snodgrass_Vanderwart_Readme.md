## Snodgrass and Vanderwart objects

These are the 260 line drawings of objects from:
Snodgrass, Joan G., and Mary Vanderwart. "A standardized set of 260 pictures: 
norms for name agreement, image agreement, familiarity, and visual complexity." 
Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Learning and Memory 6.2 (1980): 174.

The "images" folder contains the original images.

The vecLD structures were hand-taced by our team at the University of Toronto.
